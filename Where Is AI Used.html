<h1>Where Is AI Used?<h1>

<h3>
<p>These artificial intelligence examples merely scratch the surface of the volume of applications of AI today. The technology is currently deployed in numerous sectors, including transportation, manufacturing, finance, health care, education, and urban planning.<p>

<p>In transportation, for example, systems like Google Maps can analyze the speed of traffic movement at any given time, incorporating on-the-spot reports of traffic incidents like construction work or accidents.<p>

<p>Predictive and preventative maintenance systems in the manufacturing industry are helping product makers to avoid costly downtime, while the incorporation of AI into quality control mechanisms enhances production.<p>

<p>Weâ€™ve already observed that machine learning is assisting financial organizations in detecting fraud. AI and ML also play a role in payment processing, mobile check deposit, insurance, and the recommendation of investment options.<p>

<p>Artificial intelligence devices and smart connected systems are enhancing the delivery and administration of health care in numerous ways, such as remote diagnostics and telemedicine.<p>

  <p>Automated document reading, grading, and plagiarism checking powered by artificial intelligence are helping to ease the work load of educators, and providing an additional viewpoint to that of human instructors.<P>
